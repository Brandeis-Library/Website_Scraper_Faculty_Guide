Abdur-Rahman is an Associate Professor of English, African and Afro-American Studies, and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Brandeis University. She publishes and lectures widely on topics ranging from the relation of sexuality and social order in New World slavery to the impacts of Civil Rights retrenchment on black familial formation and function in the current, putatively “post-racial,” moment. A two-time winner of the Darwin T. Turner Award for Best Essay of the Year in _African American Review_, Abdur-Rahman has been awarded fellowships from the Ford Foundation, the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, the American Association of University Women, the Mellon Foundation, the W.E.B Du Bois Institute at Harvard University, and the JFK Institute at the Freie Universität Berlin. Her first book _Against the Closet: Black Political Longing and the Erotics of Race_, was published by Duke University Press in 2012. Considering genres from the slave narrative to science fiction, this book analyzes African American literary depictions of transgressive sexualities in order to illuminate the ways in which race, politics, and sexuality intersect in the social/racial ordering of United States culture and in the making of African American literature.Abdur-Rahman is currently at work on her second book, provisionally titled, _Millennial Style: The Politics of Experiment in Contemporary African Diasporic Culture." This book examines the ideological and political implications of generic experimentation in recent black fiction and visual art. It engages the work of such cultural producers as Sapphire, Marci Blackman, Kara Walker, Octavia Butler, and Wangechi Mutu to investigate the ways in which desire both shapes and resists representation. Theorizing an “aesthetics of intimacy” that upends the predominance of sentimentality and formal realism, _Millennial Style_ illuminates the centrality of aesthetic innovation to political modes of storytelling and visual representation and to the undercurrent of racial politics in contemporary black cultural production of high experiment. </profile><courses> Courses Taught   AAAS  164b Afrofuturism   AAAS/ENG  141b Critical Race Theory   AAAS/WGS  136a Black Feminist Thought   ENG  87a Sex and Race in the American Novel   ENG  138b Toni Morrison   ENG  197b Within the Veil: African-American and Muslim Women's Writing   ENG  207a Race, Desire, and the Literary Imagination   SQS  6b Sexuality and Queer Studies   </courses><awards> Awards and Honors  Darwin T.

Her most recent works converge on issues of gender and ethnic representations in neoliberal, post-authoritarian Peru. She is currently working on her book manuscript Moral Fibers: Making Fashion Ethical. The book critically explores the Peruvian alpaca wool supply chain analyzing how, through the intervention of development projects, indigenous women artisans and their aesthetic traditions are interpolated into “ethical fashion” manufacturing networks. Moral Fibers unites the fields of political economy, ethnic studies, aesthetic theory, and gender studies to expand our thinking about the parameters and exclusions encoded into “ethical capitalism.” Her latest film Entretejido weaves together the different sites and communities involved in this supply chain, bringing viewers into contact with the ways objects we wear are entangled in national racial politics and histories. The film, which premiered at the Havana International Film Festival, extends her long-standing critical engagement with aesthetic politics, sensorial and embodied forms of knowledge. She is starting to work on an ethnography and film of the color magenta exploring its symbolic, cultural, racial, gendered, political and industrial life. </profile><courses> Courses Taught   ANTH  113b Race and Ethnicity: Anthropological Perspectives   ANTH  130a Filming Culture: Ethnographic and Documentary Filmmaking   ANTH  130b Visuality and Culture   ANTH  131b Latin America in Ethnographic Perspective   ANTH  138a Digital Cultures   ANTH  152a The Social Fabric: An Anthropology of Fashion   ANTH  163a Work and Labor in Global Context   ANTH  170b Multispecies Ethnography: Anthropology Beyond the Human   </courses><awards> Awards and Honors  Best Cultural/Ethnic Documentary Film, Houston International Film Festival (2017)   Honorable Mention for Best Graduate Student Film, Society for Visual Anthropology Film Festival (2016)   Postdoctoral Fellowship, Center for the Study of Women, Gender and Sexuality, Rice University (2016 - 2017)   UC President's Dissertation Year Fellowship (2013 - 2014)   National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (2009 - 2012)  </awards><scholarship> Scholarship  Entretejido.

Since Galois representations are often difficult to construct, and even more, to study, I develop and use tools belonging to the so-called Langlands program, a large field of current research aiming at understanding deep relations between Galois representations and some more analytic objects called automorphic representations (of which on of the most famous avatar are the modular forms). </profile><courses> Courses Taught   MATH  131a Algebra I   MATH  141b Complex Analysis   MATH  200a Second-Year Seminar   MATH  201a Topics in Algebra   MATH  202a Algebraic Geometry I   MATH  203a Number Theory   MATH  203b Topics in Number Theory   </courses><awards> Awards and Honors  American Mathematical Society Centennial Fellowship (2010 - 2011)  </awards><scholarship> Scholarship Bellaïche, Joël; Green, Ben; Soundararajan, Kannan.

I am particularly interested in how Indigenous ways of knowing and caring for ancestral places can inform alternative ways of doing archaeology.My book project, Sweetgum Archaeology: The Unfinished Histories of Mound Landscapes in the Native South (under contract with University Press of Florida), focuses on the unfinished histories of mound landscapes: earthwork constructions built by diverse Native American peoples across eastern North America over the past 5,500 years. Oral traditions shared with me by my hosts situate mounds within descriptions of ancestral exchange and diplomacy practices. These stories articulate a moral geography that intertwines the mineral world, celestial formations, and living well with foreign others. Moreover, for my Indigenous hosts and teachers, mounds are animate and sentient landscapes in their own right. Living mounds extend ancestral exchange networks into the present as they draw my hosts into circulations of physically small (and intangible) but spiritually and emotionally heavy things: a glass bead, a pinch of dirt, or a dream given by an ancestor. In return, my hosts provide companionship and care for landscapes wounded by ongoing settler violence. In these moments, mounds enroll my hosts into their ongoing lives, or what I call a nonlinear, Indigenous longue durée. </profile><courses> Courses Taught   AMST/ANT  117a Decolonization: A Native American Studies Approach   AMST/ANT  122a Indigenous Ecologies   AMST/ANT  133a Deep Historical Perspectives on Native North America   </courses><awards></awards><scholarship> Scholarship Bloch, Lee J..

In particular, I am interested in "discrete surfaces" (a.k.a maps), that is, surfaces obtained by gluing polygons along their edges. The applications range from the concrete (graph drawing algorithms, encoding of computer images), to the theoretical (representation theory, random matrices, random surfaces appearing quantum mechanics and string theory). I am particularly interested in the bijections between maps and trees which are at the core of recent advances in our understanding of discrete surfaces. More generally, I am interested in bijective encoding of mathematical structures and the use of such encodings to answer questions coming from mathematics, computer science of physics. </profile><courses> Courses Taught   MATH  8a Introduction to Probability and Statistics   MATH  35a Advanced Calculus and Fourier Analysis   MATH  131a Algebra I   MATH  131b Algebra II   MATH  180a Combinatorics   MATH  180b Topics in Combinatorics   MATH  200a Second-Year Seminar   </courses><awards> Awards and Honors  NSF grant DMS 1800681, 2018-2021 (2018 - 2021)   NSF research grant: "Maps: beyond boundaries" (2013)  </awards><scholarship> Scholarship Bernardi, Olivier and Holden Nina and Sun, Xin.

Her studies in long-term services and supports (LTSS, also called long-term care) and Medicare post-acute services have been concerned with both provider and recipient behavior, considering costs, production efficiency, payment, financing, and utilization of nursing homes and home health services. Her current research concerning the LTSS workforce builds on her training as a labor economist and early research and publications on nursing labor markets. She has led or co-led evaluations of delivery system and payment innovations, developed policy analyses concerning long-term and post-acute utilization and payment, and carried out econometric analyses using data derived from national sample surveys, administrative data, and project data collection. </profile><courses> Courses Taught   HS  372b Economic Theory and Social Policy   HS  419f Introduction to Economics of Labor as Applied to Social Policy Issues   HS  480b Economic Analysis for Physicians as Managers   HS  519a Health Economics   </courses><awards> Awards and Honors  Fellow, Gerontological Society of America (2014)   Health and Aging Policy Fellow, Atlantic Philanthropies (2012 - 2013)   IPA, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, US Department of Health and Human Services; Disability Aging and Long-term Care Policy (2012 - 2013)   Member, Institute of Medicine Committee on Mental Health Workforce for Geriatric Populations (2011 - 2014)   Atran Professor of Labor Economics (2006)   Fellow, Association for Health Services Research (now AcademyHealth) (1997 - 1998)  </awards><scholarship> Scholarship Bishop, Christine E.

Reversible phosphorylation of proteins is a fundamental mechanism cells use to control their physiology; I use genetics, cell biology, mechanistic enzymology, and structural biology to identify how phosphatases achieve regulation and specificity, and how kinases and phosphatases work together to controll signaling. We address these questions in two major biological systems: 1) Phosphatases that control stress responses, developmental programs, and community behavior in bacteria. 2) Phosphatases that control human signaling pathways that drive cancer and other diseases. </profile><courses> Courses Taught   BCHM  103b Advanced Biochemistry: Cellular Information Transfer Mechanisms   </courses><awards></awards><scholarship> Scholarship Bradshaw, N., Levdikov, V.

Her work has examined changes in the gender wage gap and wage inequality in eastern Europe, the impact of World War II on marriage and fertility of Russian women, and the impact of economic transition on mortality in post-socialist countries. The scope of her work also includes a study of the impact of globalization on relative women’s wages in the United States. Current research projects include an analysis of the growing life expectancy gap between U.S. and European women, and an examination of the causes of unbalanced sex ratios in the former Soviet Union.

Brooten, Kraft-Hiatt Professor of Christian Studies; of Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies; of Classical Studies; and Chair of Religious Studies at Brandeis University, is founder and director of the Brandeis Feminist Sexual Ethics Project. This project aims to create Jewish, Christian, and Muslim sexual ethics rooted in freedom, mutuality, meaningful consent, responsibility, and pleasure for women and for persons of all genders, untainted by slave-holding values. These religions’ sacred texts and traditions have all tolerated slavery, which has frequently involved the sexual exploitation of women and girls. Brooten heads a team of scholars, activists, artists, and policy analysts who are disentangling the nexus of slavery, religion, women, and sexuality. They aim to help religious and other people complete the abolition of slavery and move beyond harmful racial and sexual stereotypes. Because religion is a powerful social force, transformed religious sexual ethics, based not on scriptural literalism or the hierarchies of ancient slave-holding societies but on respect, will benefit the whole of society.

She is also a Brandeis University Ombuds. For the past twenty-five years Cathy has focused on ways faculty, students and administrators can work together to fulfill the civic missions of their colleges and universities. This focus has been on two interrelated areas: access to higher education, especially by students who are among the first in their families to attend; and the ways in which colleges and universities engage with their communities. Her work has taken several forms including facilitating Think Tanks for senior campus administrators, co-coordinating and facilitating national meetings focused on the civic mission of research universities, directing various funded projects that support student, faculty and community representatives working together on a change initiative, and extensive work with faculty from a wide variety of institutions.Through her work at CYC Cathy works with colleges, universities, and community organizations to use evaluation to both “prove” and “improve” their programs. Her research and capacity-building efforts attend to both outcomes and systemic change. To that end Cathy has conducted evaluations of campus-based change initiatives including conducting a national evaluation of institutional support for civic engagement, developing measures of student success, helping to set up a national data collection system, and conducting multi-site evaluations on campus-wide change initiatives. Examples of some of Cathy's projects include helping Girls Who Code increase their evaluation capacity, the evaluation of Campus Compact's Connect to Complete (C2C) initiative, a pilot peer-support program at nine community colleges, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the GreenLight Fund’s Social Innovation Fund initiative evaluation, the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation's Community College Transfer Initiative, an initiative designed to enable low- and moderate-income, academically able, community college students to transfer to selective colleges and universities, and of the Nellie Mae Education Foundation’s Project Compass, a program focused on the retention of underserved students. She is currently working with her colleague Alan Melchior on a longitudinal evaluation of FIRST, a national after school robotics program. Cathy holds a Bachelors degree in Psychology from the University of Rochester, and a Doctorate in Administration, Planning and Social Policy from Harvard University. Cathy's work is under-girded by her core beliefs in the power of reflective practice, collaboration, importance of creating learning organizations, capacity building, and development of communities and the individuals who inhabit them. </profile><courses></courses><awards></awards><scholarship> Scholarship Melchior A., Burack, C., Hoover, M., Haque, Z..

Prior to joining the Heller School's faculty, he was a Senior Fellow with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. He spent most of his career--28 years--as an economist and officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. He began his career as an analyst with the Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress.  In the 1970s, when Bob first started out, he was struck by the lack of communication between academic experts in public finance, especially at the state and local level, and policymakers, policy advisers, and reporters seeking impartial, expert advice and analysis. As a result, has served as a member and/or research director of five state tax commissions in New England,and has testified scores of times around the nation at federal and state public hearings on fiscal issues and economic and financial conditions. In addition, he has published many articles, book chapters, and reports. He has been frequently invited to give presentations at conferences, symposia, and webinars, both in the U.S. and abroad. In 2005, Bob had the opportunity to create the New England Public Policy Center, a unit within the Boston Fed explicitly dedicated to providing the region's policymakers, their advisers, members of the media, and policy advocates with high quality, impartial analysis in the areas of state and local public finance, demographics, and labor market conditions. After founding the Center, Bob served as its director for five years, until his retirement from the Fed in 2010.  Bob has been active in the National Tax Association, serving as its President in 2007, the Association's centennial year. He also served as a member of the Board of Directors of the New England Economic Partnership. Bob has been a columnist for State Tax Notes, a weekly magazine specializing in state and local tax policy since 2013. </profile><courses> Courses Taught   HS  341a Public Finance and Budgeting   </courses><awards> Awards and Honors  Member, Rhode Island Tax Policy Research Group (2009)   Member, Massachusetts Study Commission on Corporate Taxation (2007)   President, National Tax Association (2007)   Member, Teaching and Research Faculty, Lincoln Institute of Land Policy (2006 - 2009)   Invitee, Senior Leadership Conference, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2005)   Member, Advisory Forum, New Mexico Tax Research Institute (2005)   Member, Board of Directors, New England Economic Partnership (2002 - 2010)   Member and Director of Research, New Hampshire Commission on Education Funding (2000)   Director of Research, Massachusetts Special Commission on Business Tax Policy (1993)   Three Presidents Awards, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, 1990 through 2001 (1990)   Executive Director, Massachusetts Special Commission on Tax Reform (1984 - 1986)   Rockefeller Foundation Research Grant (1979)   U.S. Department of Labor Dissertation Award (1979)   Danforth Graduate Fellowship (1968)  </awards><scholarship> Scholarship Tannenwald, Robert.

He has pioneered payment and incentive systems for healthcare reform for since the 1980’s. He was a member of the research team that first developed diagnosis-based risk-adjustment models for Medicare. In the 1990’s, he led the research team that pioneered development of the Medicare shared savings payment model, and the blueprint for the Physician Group Practice demonstration, which became the basis for today’s Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). In the 2000’s, he led the design of Medicare Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (HVBP), and later led the analytic support for implementation of HVBP. He directed the development of the Episode Grouper for Medicare (EGM) for CMMI as the basis for individual feedback to physicians, and Medicare physician value-based payment. Dr. Tompkins is leading support for design innovation and empirical modeling of policy options for CMS/CCSQ regarding the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS); and development of an APM with the American College of Surgeons, along with a number of surgical specialties, that is based on an episode framework for cost and quality. Dr. Tompkins led analytic support for about 100 hospitals considering participation in the Medicare Bundled Payment for Care Improvement demonstration. Also, he directed support of the Office of the National Coordinator’s Beacon Communities in relation to claims-based performance measures based on Medicare data. He also led development of prototypical bundled payment options for behavioral health in Medicaid. Dr. Tompkins has led many applied research studies, including RCTs and quasi-experimental evaluations, and has taught program evaluation, healthcare financing, and research methods. He chaired the Brandeis University IRB and HIPAA Privacy Board for eight years.Dr. Tompkins recently co-authored the NQF report (2014) on linking quality and cost measures for evaluating healthcare efficiency and value. He has led the development of NQF-endorsed performance measures related to care transitions, as well as the prototype Medicare Spending per Beneficiary measure now implemented in Medicare HVBP. </profile><courses></courses><awards></awards><scholarship> Scholarship Zhu, J, Weingart, S, Ritter, G, Tompkins, C, and Garnick, D.

These two mathematical tools allow describing properties of systems evolving in time, possibly partly randomly. I have used these tools to describe the role of disorder, fluctuations and unpredictability in neural computations, with a particular interest in understanding the interplay of structure and function in the brain, from models of single cells activity up to macroscopic limits of large stochastic neuronal areas. I have also worked on the functional organization of the visual cortex in search for their organizing principles, but also on the mechanisms leading, during embryonic development, to the emergence of appropriate brain phenotypes. My approach often involves data analysis, simplified mathematical models, computer simulations and theoretical and mathematical analysis, using dynamical systems and probability.

Unraveling this mystery requires an understanding of the relationships between the cellular-level properties of circuits – the anatomical “wiring diagram” of connectivity on the one hand, and the functional properties of single neurons and synapses on the other – and the systems-level properties such as sensory responses or motor outputs.In the Neural Circuits Lab, we are applying a new generation of optical and optogenetic tools to observe both fine-scale circuit features and systems-level responses at the same time, in the living brain. We combine these optical approaches with advanced physiological and anatomical techniques to address previously inaccessible questions about neural circuitry and its development in mammalian visual cortex.

As such, my research and teaching take a critical anthropologic approach to examining global health responses to disease, with a specific focus on China. My interests focus on the nexus of gender, sexuality, governance, and disease in China. My first book, Occupational Hazards: Sex, Business, and HIV in Post-Mao China (2016) examines how the networking practices that hold together Chinese social fabric and have led to the China's economic rise facilitated the development, transmission, and administration of China's HIV epidemic. I conducted much of the research for this book at the Chinese-Burmese border, which offers readers a unique perspective on how geopolitical relations between these two countries have affected this local HIV epidemic and the drug use epidemic that plagues the region. This work on male networking practices, which include excessive banqueting, drinking, smoking, and commercial sex, has also led me to examine how such cultural rituals affect the rising rates of chronic disease in China. Overall my research has allowed me to offer alternative cultural perspectives to explain the rise of some very pressing public health problems in China. My newest project has led me into the field of how international migration affects disease. I currently conducting research among the large community of African migrants coming to Guangzhou to engage in trade. This project, which focuses on the impact of the migration experience on risk for disease is opening up new inquires into how the emerging trend of south-south migration is affecting patterns of disease globally.My teaching covers a range of interests from medical anthropology and global health policy, including the anthropology of global health to the anthropology of China and gender and sexuality in East Asia. My teaching also focuses on methods for conducting ethnographic research and the ethics and cultural competence involved in successfully conducting such research globally. </profile><courses> Courses Taught   ANTH  140a Human Rights in Global Perspective   ANTH  140b Critical Perspectives in Global Health   ANTH  142b Global Pandemics: History, Society, and Policy   ANTH  178b Culture, Gender and Power in East Asia   ANTH  182b Applied Anthropology   IGS  136b Contemporary Chinese Society and Culture   </courses><awards></awards><scholarship> Scholarship Uretsky, Elanah.

He has taught previously at Columbia and Washington University in St. Louis. At Brandies since 2001, Unglaub teaches courses on the Art of the Renaissance and Baroque periods throughout Europe, with an emphasis on Italy. A primary area of research focus has been the art and larger literary culture of Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665), the founder of French Classicism, who worked in Rome. His scholarship on the painter encompasses two books: Poussin and the Poetics of Painting: Pictorial Narrative and the Legacy of Tasso (Cambridge University Press, 2006; paperback 2014) and Poussin's Sacrament of Ordination: History Faith and the Sacred Landscape (Yale University Press, 2013), as well as some half dozen published studies. He is completing a monograph on the painter that will appear in the Renaissance Lives series published by Reaktion Press. Beyond Poussin, Unglaub's current research ranges across the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in Italy, and includes studies on Caravaggio, Carracci, Bernini, Sebastiano del Piombo, and Venetian Renaissance pastoral painting, as well as a book project on pictorial transitivity and Marian corporeality in Raphael's Sistine Madonna and other Renaissance images of the Incarnation. Among other issues, these articles have addressed Giorgione's Concert Champêtre and the historical dimension of pastoral poetry in the Renaissance, the cutthroat patronage of Giovanni Battista Manzini in seventeenth-century Bologna, new literary sources for Bernini's famed Ecstasy of Santa Teresa, and a rediscovered portrait of Bernardo Accolti, attributed to Andrea Del Sarto, which confirms this once-celebrated poet's prominence in Raphael's Parnassus in the Vatican.His scholarship and reviews have appeared in many venues, including the Art Bulletin, Burlington Magazine, Master Drawings, Arion, caareviews, Histoire de l’Art, the Art Newspaper, as well as chapters in various scholarly anthologies. </profile><courses> Courses Taught   ENG  183b Gods and Humans in the Renaissance   FA  28a Painting Siena   FA  30a History of Art I: From Antiquity to the Middle Ages   FA  30b History of Art II: From the Renaissance to the Modern Age   FA  45a Early Renaissance Art in Tuscany from the Age of Dante to the Medici   FA  45b Art of the Early Renaissance in Italy   FA  46b High and Late Renaissance in Italy   FA  47b Renaissance Art in Northern Europe   FA  48a Baroque Art and Architecture in Italy   FA  149a The Age of Rubens, Rembrandt and Vermeer   FA  191b Studies in Renaissance and Baroque Art   </courses><awards> Awards and Honors  Membership at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, for Academic year 2017-18 (2017 - 2018)   Membership, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, School of Historical Studies (offered and declined) (2008 - 2009)   Samuel H.

Her research and teaching places gender, sexuality, development programs, and social movements in transnational perspective. In particular, her work explores how transnational forces intersect with local gendered politics in the formation of personal and collective identities. Most of her research focuses on India.Her current book project uses over 150 in-depth interviews alongside participant observation across India and Kenya to study the transnational circulation of HIV/AIDS programs. The project focuses on how activist groups of sex workers and LGBTIQ people engaged, and often challenged, corporate donors, state agencies, and biomedical experts; became central to India's HIV/AIDS response; and transformed themselves in the process. Moving across the spaces of everyday life, grassroots HIV prevention, and NGOs, Viral Politics shows that the AIDS epidemic generated a new terrain for articulating Indian sexual identity, both within and beyond India's borders.In a previous project, Professor Vijayakumar examined gendered differences in young people’s articulations of their aspirations in relation to the global knowledge economy in a small town outside Bangalore. In future work, she plans to extend her study of gender, sexuality, and political life in Bangalore and its outskirts. </profile><courses> Courses Taught   HIST/SOC  170b Gender and Sexuality in South Asia   SOC  124a Gender, Sexuality, and Globalization   SOC  150a HIV/AIDS, Society, and Politics   SOC  155b Protest, Politics, and Change: Social Movements   SOC  209b Social Movements   SOC  228b Gender and Sexuality in Transnational Perspective   SOC  300a Approaches to Sociological Research   </courses><awards> Awards and Honors  Mandel Faculty Grant in the Humanities (2019)   Social Science Research Council International Dissertation Research Fellowship (2012 - 2013)   National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (2010 - 2014)  </awards><scholarship> Scholarship Vijayakumar, Gowri.

Having yielded a book, two conference seminars, and a number of articles, the major component of his research of the past few years focuses on translation, revolution, and historical imagination in modern Chinese culture. His first monograph, titled "The Translatability of Revolution: Guo Moruo and Twentieth-Century Chinese Culture" (Harvard University Asia Center, 2018. 325pp, 9 illustrations), is the first comprehensive study in English of the lifework of Guo Moruo (1892-1978), a towering--and highly controversial--figure of China's revolutionary century who worked as a Romantic writer, Marxist historian, and prolific translator. Currently, Dr Wang is working on four scholarly projects: First, he recently started a new research project about modern Chinese travel literature, tentatively titled "The Experience of the Faraway: Travel Writing and Utopian Geopolitics in Revolutionary China." Second, he is co-editing a special issue on the transmedial representations of the ancient in modern Chinese culture for Frontiers of Literary Studies in China. Third, he is completing a volume of poetic criticism in Chinese. Fourth, he is writing a series of essays in Chinese about the controversies surrounding the global 60s and its legacies. Dr Wang also works as Chinese translator. His Chinese translation of a critical biography of German-Jewish intellectual Walter Benjamin (1892-1940) is under contract and forthcoming. In addition, Dr Wang is a poet writing in Chinese. His first book of poetry, Baota ji qita (2015), received high acclaim. </profile><courses> Courses Taught   CHIN  100a Introduction to Chinese Literature: Desire and Form   CHIN  120b Readings in Contemporary Chinese Literature: Advanced Chinese Language II   CHIN  130b China on Film: The Changes of Chinese Culture   CHIN  136b Chinese Modernism in International Context   CHIN  136bj Chinese Modernism in International Context   COML  100a Comparing Literatures and Cultures: Theory and Practice   COML  171a Literary Translation in Theory and in Practice   </courses><awards> Awards and Honors  Poet in Residence, Enclave Literature, Shenzhen, China (2018)   Theodore and Jane Norman Fund (2018)   Hu Shih Poetry Prize—Frist Book of Poetry (2016)   The Helaine and Alvin Allen Chair in Literature (2016)   Provost Research Grant (2015 - 2016)   The Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation Junior Scholar Grant (2015 - 2016)   The Kermit H.

The majority of Dr. Erickson Warfield's work has been focused in three areas. First, studies of the transition from pediatric to adult health care for youth with disabilities including autism spectrum disorders have examined the perspectives of pediatric and adult health care providers as well as those of youth and families. These studies have identified promising strategies for improving transition procedures and outcomes. Second, evaluations of various innovative models of service delivery have concentrated on how systems, providers, families, and youth interact and how procedures can be established to better coordinate care and implement novel interventions. Third, longitudinal investigations have identified several key individual, family environment, service and system level characteristics that explain variation in the physical and socio-emotional well-being of children, youth, and young adults with disabilities. Dr. Erickson Warfield has expertise in a variety of qualitative and quantitative research methods and analysis techniques and her work has been funded by a range of federal and foundation sources. </profile><courses> Courses Taught   HS  332a Research Methods and Evaluation   HS  334a Child and Family Policy: U.S. and Cross-Cultural Perspectives   HS  407b Survey Research Methods   HSSP  110a Integrative Seminar on Health   </courses><awards></awards><scholarship> Scholarship Crossman, M.K., Parish, S., Hauser-Cram, P., & Warfield, M.E..

Symmetric PCR has been the dominant method of DNA amplification for the last 20 years. Each amplicon in such assays is generated by use of two primers of equal concentration and equal Tm (melting temperature) and is therefore double-stranded. Amplification proceeds exponentially, but then slows down and reaches plateau in a stochastic manner. Thus, although such reactions are well known and are often robust, they nevertheless suffer from limitations which are particularly evident in samples containing low numbers of initial targets. These limitations include: * Design difficulties, particularly for multiplexing * Reduced efficiency and sensitivity due to mis-priming * Variability among replicate reactions, particularly at end-point * Limited availability of fluorescent colors * Limitations in probe design * Requirement for hot-start enzymes * CostsLATE-PCR and Its Allied Technologies, including PrimeSafe, Lights-On/Light-Off Probes, and Dilute-N-Go Sequencing overcomes all of the above problems and makes it possible to construct highly-informative single tube assays using fluroescent probe in several colors. These assays make it possible to simultaneously scan multiple targets for sequence variations (i.e Virtual Sequencing in a closed-tube). Over the past 15 years we have worked with several large international diagnostic companies and have built numerous assays in the fields of human and animal infectious diseases, human cancers, forensics, drug side effects, species identification, prenatal and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. We have had over 10 million dollars of funding and have built a large patent portfolio. </profile><courses> Courses Taught   BIOL  62a Genes and Human Evolution   BIOL  154b Project Lab: Barcoding and Virtual Barcoding of Species   </courses><awards> Awards and Honors  2009-2011 Sigma Xi Society - Distinguished Lecturer (2009 - 2011)   Feldman Brothers Award for Course Development in human reproduction and population explosion (1999)   Helen Hay Whitney Postdoctoral Fellowship (1973 - 1975)  </awards><scholarship> Scholarship Heather Schiller, John Deng, Elaine Lai, Chandler Fulton, and Lawrence Wangh.

Lewis Theobald, Ph.D., is an Assistant Professor of French and Francophone Studies. Her research has three main foci: early modern French literature, word and image studies (particularly portraiture and illustrated books), and Québec Studies. Many of her publications focus on visual imagery in early modern prose and early book engravings. In journals such as French Forum, Papers on French Seventeenth-Century Literature, and Women in French Studies, she explores the idea that the literary portrait, despite its reputation as a mere salon game, has an evolving presence in a large body of early modern writing. Several of her publications address questions of gender, identity, viewing, and pleasure in early modern illustrated novels, and her newest projects examine the print culture around eighteenth-century marvels like the Montgolfier balloons and the role of picturing in early epistolary novels. Dr Theobald strives to enrich her teaching by bringing her research into the classroom at all levels. She has developed and taught upper-level classes in French entitled "Reading Versailles: Portrait, Space, and Spectacle under the Sun King," "La Révolution tranquille?: Québec’s Culture Wars on Stage and Screen," and "Le Livre illustré," or illustrated texts from illuminated manuscripts to contemporary comics. She is currently developing a class on humor in francophone texts and is thrilled to be a part of the Brandeis community. </profile><courses> Courses Taught   FREN  32a Intermediate French: Conversation   FREN  104b Advanced Language Skills through Culture   FREN  105a France Today: French Conversation   FREN  106b Writing Workshop   FREN  129a La Révolution tranquille?: Québec's Culture Wars on Stage and Screen   FREN  146a Picturing Versailles: Portrait, Space and Spectacle under the Sun King   FREN  149b Le Livre Illustré: Word and Image in Francophone Texts from Bestiaries to Bandes Dessinées   FREN  159b Wordplay: Humor in Francophone Texts   </courses><awards> Awards and Honors  Theodore and Jane Norman Award for Faculty Research (2015)   PSC-CUNY research grant for work in Paris (2008 - 2010)   CUNY William Stewart Travel Award (2006)   College of Staten Island CELT grant (Departmental technology grant) (2006 - 2007)   PSC-CUNY research grant for work in Oxford and Paris (2006 - 2008)   University of Colorado: Andrée Kail Dissertation Award (2004)   Rocky Mountain MLA Graduate Student Travel Award (2003)   Beth Leapley Memorial Grant for Research at the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris (2002)   Gladys Manning Award for Dissertation Research (2002)   Thomas Edwin Devaney Dissertation Fellowship (2002 - 2003)   University of Colorado at Boulder: Newberry Library Research Grant (2002)   University of Colorado Graduate Student Teaching Excellence Award (2000)   University of Colorado Graduate Fellowship (1999 - 2004)   Summa Cum Laude (1992)   University of Tennessee, Knoxville: Valedictorian/ Top Graduating Senior in the College of Liberal Arts, Humanities (1992)  </awards><scholarship> Scholarship Theobald, Catherine.

I majored in "Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry" at Yale, and only really became a Biologist as a graduate student at MIT. During my graduate student years, most of my energy was focused on my research: biochemical and genetic experiments to better understand the roles, activity, and regulation of DNA damage response factors in yeast and bacteria which enable copying of UV-damaged DNA molecules. However, I was also already deeply interested in teaching. I learned a tremendous amount about teaching by TAing, and I found additional opportunities to engage in conversations about teaching and learning, through the MIT HHMI Education Group. After completing my PhD, while I continued my research, my focus turned to teaching. I taught introductory biology at MIT for a semester as a Technical Instructor, worked for a couple of years teaching in the High School Outreach Program at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and taught Biochemistry at Suffolk University.I have been at Brandeis for about five years. I teach the introductory course in Genetics and Genomics, Biol14a, which is taken by many first- and second-year undergraduate students. I also teach courses in molecular biology and cancer biology. In 2013-14, I had the honor of being one of the Davis Fellows, a group of faculty working together to share and develop our best practices in teaching. I have twice received Provost's Teaching Innovation Grants, for two different projects, in 2015 and in 2018. </profile><courses> Courses Taught   BIOL  14a Genetics and Genomics   BIOL  72a Genetics Principles and Applications   BIOL  101a Molecular Biotechnology   BIOL  162b DNA: Mechanisms and Research   BIOL  172b Growth Control and Cancer   </courses><awards></awards><scholarship> Scholarship Kim YI, Levchenko I, Fraczkowska K, Woodruff RV, Sauer RT, Baker TA.

He teaches undergraduate courses and graduate seminars on American political and legal history (from the colonial period to the present), crime and punishment in U.S. history, the Gilded Age and Progressive Era, and the literature of American history. Willrich received his A.B. at Yale University and his MA and PhD at the University of Chicago. His scholarship centers on the social, legal, and political history of the United States since the Civil War. He is especially interested in how ordinary people experienced, tangled with, and shaped the increasingly powerful interventionist state that emerged with the rise of a new urban-industrial society around the turn of the twentieth century. Willrich's first book, CITY OF COURTS: Socializing Justice in Progressive Era Chicago (Cambridge University Press, 2003), traces the rise of radical new ideas about the social causes of crime in modern industrial cities and the new institutions of law and liberal governance that those ideas helped bring into being. His second book, POX: An American History (Penguin Press, 2011), tells the story of the great wave of smallpox epidemics that struck America and its overseas territories around the turn of the twentieth century, spurring the growth of modern public health authority, and engendering widespread social and legal opposition to the government policy of compulsory vaccination. Currently, Willrich is working on a book (to be published by Basic Books) about anarchists, radical lawyers, and the rule of law in the United States during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He has also begun research on two other projects: a political history of sports in the United States, and a post-frontier history of Americans who have strived to live "off the grid." A 2015 Guggenheim Fellow, Willrich’s scholarship has been supported by fellowships from the American Council of Learned Societies, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Newberry Library, the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, and the Mandel Center for the Humanities. A former journalist, his writing has appeared in the New York Times, The New Republic, The Washington Monthly, Washington City Paper, and Mother Jones. </profile><courses> Courses Taught   HIST  160a American Legal History I   HIST  160b American Legal History II   HIST  168b America in the Progressive Era: 1890-1920   HIST  200b Colloquium in American History   HIST  201a Major Problems in American Legal History   </courses><awards> Awards and Honors  OAH Distinguished Lecturer, reappointed (2016 - 2019)   American Council of Learned Societies Full Faculty Fellowship (2015 - 2016)   Guggenheim Fellowship (2015 - 2016)   Mandel Faculty Grant in the Humanities (2015)   National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Stipend (2015)   William H.

Our approach to this question is focused on rapid speech comprehension, and memory for what has been heard. A major factor we examine is the effect of reduced hearing acuity, as hearing loss, whether mild, moderate, or more severe, often accompanies normal aging. In addition to these sensory changes are age-sensitive reductions in the capacity of working memory and speed of perceptual processing that would paradoxically seem to predict far more serious decrements in spoken language comprehension than one actually sees in healthy aging. At the same time, the perceptual effort due to even a mild hearing loss may bring a cost to successful speech perception in the form of a draw on attentional resources that would otherwise be available for understanding speech with complex syntax, or encoding the speech in memory. We then use computer editing of speech to add structural coherence, prosodic contour and linguistic constraints to the speech to explore how these features are used by older adults to bring their performance to a level more closely approaching that of the young. In this way we are able to examine the delicate interplay between "top-down" contextual support (at both the acoustic and linguistic levels) as it may be used to supplement the declining sensory, or "bottom-up" analysis of the acoustic signal itself. Dr. Wingfield and his collaborators also use functional brain imaging as an added tool in this exploration. </profile><courses> Courses Taught   NPSY  196b Advanced Topics in Cognition   NPSY  199a Human Neuropsychology   </courses><awards> Awards and Honors  Elected Member, The Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives (2013)   Baltes Distinguished Research Achievement Award from the American Psychological Association (2010)   Fellow, American Psychological Society (1999)   National Institute on Aging MERIT (Method to Extend Research in Time) Award for studies on human memory (1998 - 2003)   Chair, Human Development and Aging Study Section, Division of Research Grants, National Institutes of Health (1996 - 1997)   Fellow, Gerontological Socciety of America.

Another book, The Other Kang Youwei: Calligrapher, Art Activist, and Aesthetic Reformer in Modern China (Brill, 2016), explores the art theory and legacy of the late Qing-early Republican reformer whose paradigmatic thinking about painting and calligraphy cast a long shadow on modern/contemporary Chinese art discourses. She is the co-editor of the volume, Fashion, Identity, and Power in Modern Asia (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018), which deals with dress reforms in China, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Korea between the late nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries. In addition, she has begun research on 20th-century ink painting in Taiwan that intersects with gouache and oil painting. Her areas of interest include painting, calligraphy, institutional history, and historiography.
